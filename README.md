TDD excersises in Python
========================

What's this all about?
----------------------

This repository is a selection of excersises I'll be using to get myself out of the habit of writing defensive tests rather than offensive ones.
Defensive tests are tests that you write after you've produced your original code to ensure it works. This works most of the time but generally, TDD is a better approach since it forces you to have  a testable API in your project.
__Plus:__ All the tests are ready to be executed when the project is done. Testing doesn't become a chore to do after some functionality has finished, it is rather a *requirement* to implement a feature in the first place.

What platform will you be using?
--------------------------------

I'll be using Python 3.6 and all the tools available to me via the standard library that Python provides you with.
If I'm using a special requirement that is to be pulled in via __pip__, I'll specify that inside a `requirements.txt` file.

If you want to follow me along, provide some excersises to do or just learn for yourself: Be my guest :)
